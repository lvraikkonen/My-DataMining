OK, that is great\n\n\nTo compile me, use\n\n\n```{r compile, eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(knitr)\nknit('knitr-minimal.Rmd')\n```\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nMarkdown is super easy to write.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  \n>http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones \n>\n> Here are the data for the project: \n> \n> https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip \n> \n> You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. \n> \n> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.\n> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.\n> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.\n> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.\n> 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. \n> \n> Good luck!\n\n\nSteps to reproduce this project\n-------------------------------\n1. Open the R script `run_analysis.r` using a text editor.\n2. Change the parameter of the `setwd` function call to the working directory/folder (i.e., the folder where these the R script file is saved).\n3. Run the R script `run_analysis.r`. It calls the R Markdown file, `run_analysis.Rmd`, which contains the bulk of the code.\n\nOutputs produced\n----------------\n* Tidy dataset file `DatasetHumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphones.txt` (tab-delimited text)\n* Codebook file `codebook.md` (Markdown)\n\n## Test script\n```r\na <- c(1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)\n```\n`asd`\n\n\n\nPreliminaries\n-------------\n\nLoad packages.\n\n\n```r\npackages <- c(\"data.table\", \"reshape2\")\nsapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)\n```\n\n```\n## data.table   reshape2 \n##       TRUE       TRUE\n```\n\n\nSet path.\n\n\n```r\npath <- getwd()\npath\n```\n\n```\n## [1] \"C:/Users/chanb/Documents/Repositories/Coursera/GettingAndCleaningData/Project\"\n```\n\n\n\nGet the data\n------------\n\nDownload the file. Put it in the `Data` folder. **This was already done on 2014-04-11; save time and don't evaluate again.**\n\n\n```r\nurl <- \"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip\"\nf <- \"Dataset.zip\"\nif (!file.exists(path)) {\n    dir.create(path)\n}\ndownload.file(url, file.path(path, f))\n```\n\n\nUnzip the file. **This was already done on 2014-04-11; save time and don't evaluate again.**\n\n\n```r\nexecutable <- file.path(\"C:\", \"Program Files (x86)\", \"7-Zip\", \"7z.exe\")\nparameters <- \"x\"\ncmd <- paste(paste0(\"\\\"\", executable, \"\\\"\"), parameters, paste0(\"\\\"\", file.path(path, \n    f), \"\\\"\"))\nsystem(cmd)\n```\n\n\nThe archive put the files in a folder named `UCI HAR Dataset`. Set this folder as the input path. List the files here.\n\n",
